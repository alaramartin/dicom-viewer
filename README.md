# DICOM Viewer

Visualize DICOM images and analyze corresponding metadata all in one place, without leaving VSCode.

## Features

- View DICOM images directly side-by-side with a table containing tags, value representations (VRs), and the data itself
- Activated as soon as you open a DICOM fileâ€”no extra steps
- Metadata panel automatically closes when focus is shifted away from the original DICOM image, reducing workspace clutter

### Example

Note: this extension currently cannot display the official name or VR of private tags and does not support displaying compressed DICOMs.

## Installation

Click the "Install" button. No additional dependencies to worry about :)
